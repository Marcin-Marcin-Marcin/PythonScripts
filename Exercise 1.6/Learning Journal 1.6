Exercise 1.6

1. What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

Databases store information in an organized way so programs can easily find and update it.
They keep data safe, structured, and easy to manage.
Using databases is better than saving data in files because you can search, edit, and connect information quickly.

2. List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

INT Stores whole numbers, such as IDs or quantities.
VARCHAR Stores text of variable length, like names or descriptions.
DATE Stores calendar dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

3. In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

SQLite is good for small projects or local apps that don’t need a server.
It saves data in one simple file and is easy to set up and test.
It’s often used for learning, prototypes, or mobile apps.

4. What are the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

Python is easier to read and understand, with simple and clear syntax.
JavaScript is mainly used in web development and works directly in browsers.
Python is better for data, automation, and backend work, while JavaScript makes websites interactive.

5. What are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

Python can be slower because it’s not compiled.
It’s not the best choice for mobile apps or very large systems.
Still, it’s flexible, beginner-friendly, and powerful for many kinds of projects.
