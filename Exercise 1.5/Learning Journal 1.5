1. What is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes code into reusable objects that combine data and behavior.
It makes programs easier to manage, update, and reuse. Instead of writing the same code many times,
you define classes once and create objects from them. OOP keeps code structured and helps build larger
programs more efficiently.

2. What are objects and classes in Python? Give a real-world example.

A class is like a template, and an object is an instance of that template. For example, a Car class defines
what all cars have in common, such as color or speed. Each car object made from the class has its own details,
like a red Toyota or a blue Audi.

3. In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine. 

Inheritance

Inheritance lets one class take on the properties and methods of another. The base class shares its features
with the subclass, which can also add or change them. For example, a Dog class can inherit from Animal,
keeping the basic traits but adding its own method, like “bark()”.

Polymorphism

Polymorphism means using the same method name in different classes but getting different results.
For example, both Cat and Dog can have a “speak()” method, but one says “Meow” and the other “Woof.”
This helps write flexible code that works for many object types.

Operator Overloading

Operator overloading lets you define how operators like + or - work for your own classes.
For example, you can make a Height class where “+” adds two height objects together.
It makes custom objects behave like built-in types and keeps code readable.
