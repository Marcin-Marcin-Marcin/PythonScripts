Exercise 1.7

1. What is an Object-Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?

An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) connects Python classes and objects with database tables and records.
It lets you work with data through Python code instead of writing SQL commands.
This makes code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.
It also helps prevent SQL errors and makes it easier to switch between different databases if needed.

2. How did it go building the Recipe app? What went well and what would you improve?

Building the Recipe app went well. It was satisfying to see everything come together from the earlier lessons.
The database connection worked smoothly, and the menu made it easy to add, view, and edit recipes.
If I could improve something, I’d make the menu layout clearer and add more helpful error messages for users.

3. How would you describe this project in a job interview?

I would say that I built a command-line Recipe app in Python using SQLAlchemy ORM.
The app connects to a MySQL database and lets users create, view, search, edit, and delete recipes.
I designed the Recipe class, set up the database connection, and made sure the program handled input errors without crashing.

4. Reflection on Achievement 1

This Achievement taught me how Python works with files, databases, and classes.
I learned how to build structured programs that save and manage data effectively.
I’m proud that I completed a working project that uses real database operations.
The hardest part was setting up the database connection and understanding how ORM converts Python code into SQL.
