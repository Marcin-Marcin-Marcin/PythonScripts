REFLECTION QUESTIONS

1 Why use iPython instead of the default shell?

iPython is more user friendly. Syntax highlighting, auto indentation, tab completion, and command history
make coding smoother. It’s also quicker to test small chunks of code compared to the default shell.

2 Four examples of Python data types

int:whole numbers like 9 or -9 (scalar)
float: decimal numbers like 9.9 (scalar)
str: strings of text like "hello world" (scalar)
list: ordered collections (non-scalar)

3 What’s the difference between lists and tuples?

Lists are mutable: it is possible to add or change items.
Tuples are immutable: they cannot be changed once created.
Lists are better when data needs to change, tuples are safer for constant data.

4 Best data structure for a flashcard app?

A dictionary would be the best for flashcards. Contents of a flashcard - words, definitions, and categories
need labels.
Cards would be contained in a list, which would make them easy to loop through, add or remove.
That setup also leaves room to add more fields later.
