Exercise 1.2

Task 1.2 - created a small structure to store recipes using Python data types.
Each recipe contains: name, cooking time, ingredients.
Recipes are stored in a collection.

ANSWERS

1 Why a dictionary for a recipe?

I used a dictionary for each recipe because it lets me store named fields alongside their values.
This way everything stays consistent and is easy to update later.
Additionally, dictionaries are flexible: if I ever need to add extra details like "servings", I can
just add it without changing the overall structure.

2 Why a list for all_recipes?

I used a list for "all_recipes" because it keeps the recipes in order and makes it simple to browse, add new ones
or remove when needed.
Lists are perfect for storing multiple items of the same type, they give option to slice or sort.
