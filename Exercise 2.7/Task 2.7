* Search Idea *

Users can search recipes by name, ingredients and maximum cooking time.

Partial search is supported, so typing part of a name like “che” will still find “Cheese” using icontains.

Search results are shown as a table with recipe name, cooking time, difficulty and ingredients.
Each recipe name is clickable and opens the recipe detail page.

If the form is submitted empty, all recipes are displayed.
