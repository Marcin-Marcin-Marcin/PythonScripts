Exercise 2.7

1. Why data analysis is useful in applications

Web applications collect different kinds of data, such as user searches, clicks, or usage patterns.
Analyzing this data helps improve the application and make better decisions.
For example: a recipe app can analyze which recipes are searched most often and use this to
highlight popular dishes or suggest similar recipes.

2. How a Django QuerySet can be evaluated

A QuerySet can be evaluated in several ways such as looping over it, counting results or checking if
it contains any data.
Methods like values() and values_list() allow access to the data in different formats.
QuerySets are evaluated lazily meaning the database is only queried when the data is actually needed.

3. QuerySet vs DataFrame

QuerySets are mainly used to retrieve and filter data from the database.
DataFrames provided by pandas are better suited for data processing tasks like calculations, grouping,
and visualization.
This makes DataFrames a good choice when preparing data for charts and reports.
