Exercise 2.2

1. Converting a company website into Django terms

If I had to describe a company’s website in Django terms, I would treat the entire website as one project.
Then I would break the main features into separate apps. For example, a website might have a login area,
a product catalog, a blog, and a user profile section. Each of these would become its own app with a clear
purpose. The project brings all apps together, while each app handles one part of the site’s functionality.

2. Steps to deploy a basic Django application locally

To deploy a Django app locally, I would start by creating and activating a virtual environment. Then I would
install Django and create a new project with startproject. After that, I would run migrations to set up the
default database. Finally, I would start the server with runserver and open the provided localhost link in
the browser. These steps let me see the basic Django setup running without writing any custom code yet.

3. Using the Django admin site during development

The Django admin site is useful for managing data while building the application. I can log in as a superuser
and add or edit records directly from the browser. It also lets me manage users and check that my models are
working correctly. During development, this makes it easier to test how the database behaves before creating
my own views or forms.
