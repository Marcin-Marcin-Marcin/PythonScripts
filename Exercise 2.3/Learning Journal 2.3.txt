Exercise 2.3
1. How Django models work and what their benefits are

Django models are Python classes that represent the structure of your database. Each model becomes a table
and each class attribute becomes a column. Django handles all the database operations for you so you don’t
need to write SQL yourself.
The benefit is that your data stays organized, consistent and easier to manage. You can create, update,
and search for records using simple Python code which makes development faster and less error prone.

2. Why writing tests from the beginning is important

Writing tests early helps make sure your application works the way you expect as it grows. Every change you
make could introduce a small bug and tests can catch these problems right away.
For example: in a recipe app tests can check that a recipe name isn’t too long. If something breaks,
the tests will show it immediately. This saves time, keeps the project stable
and makes it easier to add new features.
