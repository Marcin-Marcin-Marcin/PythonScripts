Exercise 2.4

1. How Django views work

A Django view decides what the user should see when they visit a certain URL. When someone opens a page,
the view receives the request, runs some Python code, and returns a response. Most of the time, this response
is an HTML template. For example, if the user visits the homepage, the view will load the correct HTML file
and show it in the browser.

2. Function-based views vs. class-based views

If I had to reuse a lot of code in many places, I would choose class-based views. They let me organize
repeated logic inside classes, which makes the code easier to maintain. Function-based views are simple and
easy to understand, but they can get repetitive in bigger projects. Class-based views help avoid writing the
same code several times.

3. Basics of the Django Template Language

The Django Template Language lets me mix Pythonstyle data with regular HTML. Some basic parts are:

Variables like name  to show values on the page.
Tags like % if % or % for % to add simple logic.
Filters to adjust how data is displayed (for example> making text uppercase).
Template inheritance so pages can share a common layout.
These tools make it easier to build pages that update based on the data in the app.
