Exercise 2.5

1. Django static files and how Django handles them

Static files are things like images, CSS, and JavaScript that don’t change when the app is running. Django keeps
them in a
special place so they stay organized.
To use them in a page, you load the static tag and then link to the file. Django then knows exactly where to
find these files and how to show them in the browser.

2. ListView and DetailView

ListView
ListView shows a list of items from the database. It saves time because Django handles the database query
for you and sends everything to the template automatically.

DetailView
DetailView shows one single item, such as one recipe. It finds the correct object by its ID and makes it
available in the template. This makes it easy to build pages with full details.

3. Reflection

This lesson helped me understand how to display real data on a page and how views, templates, and models
work together. I’m happy that I was able to show images and build pages that list recipes and show their details.
I still want to practice writing tests and get more comfortable with class-based views, but overall I feel
I’m making good progress.
