Exercise 2.8: Deploying a Django Project
1. Using CSS and JavaScript in a Django application

CSS and JavaScript are used to improve how a Django application looks and behaves.
CSS is responsible for layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, which helps make pages clearer and more pleasant to use.
JavaScript can be used to add small interactive elements, such as dynamic feedback or simple logic.
In Django, CSS and JavaScript files are handled as static files and linked inside templates so they can be reused across different pages.

2. Steps to deploy a Django web application

First the project needs to be prepared for production by updating settings, securing the secret key, and turning off debug mode.
Next production tools such as Gunicorn and WhiteNoise are added, and all required packages are listed in a requirements file.
The code is then pushed to GitHub and connected to a hosting service like Heroku.
Finally a database is set up, migrations are applied, static files are collected and the application is tested online to ensure everything works correctly.

3. Final reflection

This Achievement helped me understand the full process of building and deploying a Django application.
I’m proud that I was able to deploy my project online and solve real deployment issues along the way.
The most challenging part was configuring the production environment and fixing dependency and database errors.
Overall this Achievement gave me confidence to continue working with Django and to include this project in my portfolio.
