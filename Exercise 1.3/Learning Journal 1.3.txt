Reflection Questions

1. Travel App Script

destination = input("Where would you like to travel? ").strip().title()

if destination == "Berlin":
    print("Have a nice stay in Berlin!")
elif destination == "Zurich":
    print("Have a nice Stay in Zurich!")
elif destination == "Geneve":
    print("Have a nice stay in Geneve!")
else:
    print("We are sorry - the desired destination is currently not available.")

Explanation:

This script asks the user where they would like to travel and checks their answer against three destinations.
Based on their input, it either prints a custom message or a default one if the place is not on the list.
The if-elif-else structure makes it easy to handle different options in a clear and organized way.

2. Interview Question: Explain logical operators in Python

Logical operators let you combine or change conditions in your code:

and: returns True only when both conditions are true

or: returns True if at least one condition is true

not: flips condition’s value (so True becomes False, and vice versa)

3. What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?

Functions are chunks of code you can reuse whenever you need to perform a specific task.
They help keep your program organized, easier to read, and simpler to update.
Once you define a function, you can call it as many times as you like with different inputs, which saves time
and avoids repeating the same code.

They’re especially useful when projects start getting bigger. Functions keep your code neat and modular.

4. Progress Toward Personal Goals

I’ve made good progress on my first goal. I’m now much more comfortable with Python basics and can write small
scripts. I also feel more at ease understanding how conditionals, loops, and functions work together.
