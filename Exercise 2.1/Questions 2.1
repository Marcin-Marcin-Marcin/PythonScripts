Write two to three sentences on why Django is so popular among web developers.

Django is popular because it includes many useful features right from the start, such as routing, a database
layer, an admin panel, and user authentication. This makes it faster to build web applications without setting
everything up yourself. It is also written in Python, which is easy to read, and it has a large community that
provides helpful support and many add-on tools.


After some research, list five large companies that use Django. Specify what the company’s product or service is

because it helped them build features quickly and support millions of users as the platform grew.

For each of the following scenarios, explain if you would use Django (and why or why not):

You need to develop a web application with multiple users.
Yes. Django already includes tools for handling users, sessions, and permissions. This makes it easier to
build a multi-user app without writing everything from scratch.

You need fast deployment and the ability to make changes as you proceed.
Yes. Django comes with many built-in features, so you can set up the main parts of your app quickly.
Its structure also makes it easy to update and add new features as you go.

You need to build a very basic application, which doesn’t require any database access or file operations.
No. Django is too heavy for a very simple app. A lighter tool like Flask or even a basic HTML page would be
easier and faster to use.

You want to build an application from scratch and want a lot of control over how it works.
No. Django expects you to follow its structure, so you have less freedom to shape everything yourself. A smaller
framework gives more flexibility if you want full control.

You’re about to start working on a big project and are afraid of getting stuck and needing additional support.
Yes. Django is a good choice for large projects because it is reliable and well-documented. Its big community also
makes it easier to find help when you need it.
