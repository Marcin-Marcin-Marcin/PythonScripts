Exercise 2.1

1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use plain Python for a project
or a framework like Django. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

Plain Python gives you a lot of freedom because you build everything yourself. This can be good for very small
or very custom projects, but it also takes more time and effort to set up basic features.
Django is faster to work with because many useful tools are already included. It helps keep your code organised
and secure, but it also expects you to follow its structure, which gives you less control over every detail.

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of MVT architecture over MVC?

The biggest advantage of MVT is that Django handles most of the controller work for you. This means you write
less code and can focus more on the parts of the app that matter to the user. It also makes the project easier
to structure because each part has a clear role.

3. Three goals for myself during this Achievement

Goal 1: I want to learn how a Django project is structured and how models, views, and templates work together.
Goal 2: I want to practice building basic web pages, connecting them to a database, and showing real data on the
screen.
Goal 3: I want to feel confident creating small Django projects on my own and be able to turn my Recipe app into
a simple web app.
