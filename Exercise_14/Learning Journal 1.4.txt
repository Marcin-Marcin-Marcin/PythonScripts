1. Why is file storage important when using Python?

File storage lets your program save data so you can use it again later.
If you don’t store local files, all the data would disappear once the program ends.
Saving files is essential for keeping progress, settings, or results between sessions.

2. What are pickles and when would you use them?

Pickles are Python objects saved in a binary format using the pickle module.
They let you store things like lists or dictionaries and load them later exactly as they were.
You’d use pickles when working only in Python and when you need to save complex data structures easily.

3. How do you check or change your working directory in Python?

To see your current directory:

import os
os.getcwd()

To change it:

os.chdir("path/to/folder")

These commands help control where your program reads and saves files.

4. How can you stop an error from crashing your whole script?

Use a try-except block.
Code that might fail goes inside try, and the except part handles what happens if it does.
This keeps the script running instead of stopping completely.

5. Progress Toward Personal Goals
I feel good about how things are going. I understand file handling better.
I still need more practice with python, but I’m gaining confidence with each lesson.
