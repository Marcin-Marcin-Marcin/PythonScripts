Exercise 2.6

Why authentication is important in a web application

Authentication controls who can access certain parts of an application. Some pages should only be available
to logged-in users.
For example in a recipe app, everyone can see the homepage but only logged-in users can view recipe details.
This improves security and keeps the application organized.

Steps to create a login in a Django application

First, you create a login view that shows a login form and checks the user’s input.
A GET request displays the form, and a POST request processes the username and password.
Next, you create a login template and connect the view to a URL like /login.
Finally, you protect selected pages so unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.

Django functions used for authentication

authenticate()
Checks if the provided username and password are correct and returns the user if they are valid.

redirect()
Sends the user to another page, for example after logging in or logging out.

include()
Lets you connect URL files from different apps to keep the project structure clean and organized.
